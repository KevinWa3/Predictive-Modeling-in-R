# Predictive-Modeling-in-R
Predicting Trade Union Status Using Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Neural Network, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).<br /> <br />
The target variable of interest is a binary indicator of whether an individual stays or leaves a hypothetical trade union. There are 999 total observations, which was split into training and validation (no test set). I chose 17 principal components, which accounts for 93% of the variance, by plotting scree plots and using Kaiser's Rule, which is based on keeping principal components with eigenvalues greater than 1. Of the 4 models, the highest accuracy score on the validation data belonged to the GLM model at 80%. <br /> <br />
